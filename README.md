STROKE PREDICTION:
This project aims to predict the likelihood of a person having a stroke based on various health-related features such as age, hypertension, heart disease, glucose level, BMI, and lifestyle factors.The solution uses Machine Learning algorithms to classify whether a patient is at risk of stroke or not.

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
Built a complete ML pipeline for healthcare risk prediction

Performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and EDA

Trained multiple ML models and compared accuracies

Selected the best model based on performance metrics

Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
